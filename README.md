# Marble It Up! Level Creation Kit

Here you will find a set of tools to create custom Marble It Up! level files.
There are a few things you'll need to know before getting started.

## Additional tools

The MIU Level Creation Kit is built on top of the Unity game engine. Before you
download this kit, you'll need to install it (Unity 2017.2 and above).<br>
You will also need a mesh creation tool, either an external 3D modelling software
or a Unity asset (we recommend using the Unity asset [ProBuilder](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/probuilder-111418) because it's free and is what's used to make all the official Marble It Up! levels).

### Installing

Download Unity and create a new project. Then either download the entire MIU folder
included here and drag it into the Assets folder of your project, or download the
MIULevelKit.unitypackage file, open it, and follow the on-screen instructions.
